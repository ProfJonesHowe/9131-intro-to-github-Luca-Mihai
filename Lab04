  <h1>My favorite hobby is: Listening to Music</h1>
  <h2> Why I enjoy listening to music</h2>
  <h3> It helps me relax and keeps me peaceful</h3>

<p>
  Listening to music is one of my favorite hobbies since I can transition through a bunch of feelings and or moods.
  If I am sad, I can play something to make me happy, or if I want to get hyped up, I can play a song that would match my mindset. 
  I listen to all kinds of genres but I really enjoy hyperpop or rap songs. Party music, as well, is one of my favorite genres. 
  My favorite artist to listen to as of now is Ken Carson I think his music is very niche, and I like his flow.
